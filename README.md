## About the Repository

This repository includes various Python scripts created during lab sessions for **Semester 1 - Introduction to Python Programming**.  
Each file demonstrates the implementation of key programming concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Conditional Statements  
- Loops (For and While)  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries  
- File Handling  
- Basic Algorithmic Thinking
